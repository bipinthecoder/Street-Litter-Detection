# litter_detection_model

Street litter has been a major contributor to environmental pollution for a long time.

This Project focuses on building a model that detects Litters on Street.

## Models Explored:
RCNN with VGG16 classifier and YOLOv8 - medium, nano and small models

## Dataset:
Photos of litters on streets were captured from 2 cities: Falkirk, Scotland, UK and Punalur, Kerala, India
using mobile camera and a standard digital camera.

## Technologies used:

- Python
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
